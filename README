# Summary
#---------

 G'MIC is an open and full-featured framework for image processing.
 It provides several different user interfaces to convert/manipulate/filter/visualize
 generic image datasets, ranging from 1d scalar signals to 3d+t sequences of
 multi-spectral volumetric images, including 2d color images.

 Technically speaking, what it does is:

 * Define a lightweight but powerful script language (the G'MIC language)
   dedicated to the design of image processing operators and pipelines.

 * Provide several user interfaces embedding the corresponding interpreter:

   - A command-line executable 'gmic', to use the G'MIC framework from a
     shell.
   - A plug-in 'gmic_gimp', to bring G'MIC capabilities to the GIMP
     image retouching software.
   - A web-service 'G'MIC Online', to allow users applying image processing
     algorithms directly in a web browser.
   - A Qt-based interface 'ZArt', for real-time manipulation of webcam images.
   - A thread-safe C++ library 'libgmic', to be linked to third-party applications.

 G'MIC is focused on the design of possibly complex pipelines for converting,
 manipulating, filtering and visualizing generic 1d/2d/3d multi-spectral image
 datasets. This includes of course color images, but also more complex data
 as image sequences or 3d(+t) volumetric float-valued datasets.

 G'MIC is an open framework: the default script language can be extended with
 custom G'MIC-written commands, defining thus new image available filters or
 effects. By the way, it already contains a substantial set of pre-defined image
 processing algorithms and pipelines (more than 1000).

 G'MIC has been designed with portability in mind, and runs on different
 platforms (Windows, Unix, MacOSX). It is distributed under the CeCILL license
 (GPL-compatible). Since 2008, it has been developed in the Image Team of the
 GREYC laboratory, in Caen/France, by permanent researchers working in the field
 of image processing on a daily basis.

 the GPL (using those files in a distributed closed-source project is then
 forbidden).

# How to install the GIMP plug-in
#---------------------------------

  GIMP (http://www.gimp.org) is an open-source painting and image retouching
  software which can be extended with additional 'plug-ins'.
  G'MIC provides such a plug-in, named 'gmic_gimp'. To install the G'MIC
  plug-in for GIMP, you have to copy the file 'gmic_gimp' (Unix) or
  'gmic_gimp.exe' (Windows) to the plug-in folder of your GIMP installation.

  This folder is usually located at:

  - on Unix: '$HOME/.gimp-2.x/plug-ins/' (for local installation),
             or 'usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/' (for global installation).

  - on Windows: 'C:\Program Files\GIMP-2.x\lib\gimp\2.0\plugins\'
                (for global installation, see notes below for other options).

  - on MacOSX: '$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Gimp/plug-ins/'
               (for installation from GimponOSX Gimp 2.6).

               '$HOME/Library/GIMP/2.8/plug-ins/'
               (for installation from GimponOSX Gimp 2.8+).

  Notes for Windows:

  You may prefer to install the plugin for individual users and avoid having
  to save into the program files folder.  The location differs depending on
  your version of Windows and can be configured in GIMP 2.8, for example:

  - on Windows 7: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.gimp-2.8\plug-ins

  - on Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\.gimp-2.8\plug-ins

  See the FAQ for more information.
